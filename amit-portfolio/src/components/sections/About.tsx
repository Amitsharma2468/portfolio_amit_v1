        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          I am a passionate and results-driven software engineering student with
          hands-on experience in building scalable web applications and
          platforms. I have successfully developed secure payment systems,
          real-time registration portals, and dynamic admin panels using modern
          technologies like Next.js, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          My work spans event management, on-demand services, AI chatbot
          integration, and mobile app development, reflecting my versatility
          across full-stack development and cloud technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          In addition to practical projects, I am an active competitive
          programmer with a strong problem-solving background, having completed
          over 750 problems on platforms like Codeforces and CodeChef. I
          continuously seek to expand my knowledge in AI and machine learning,
          demonstrated by my work on personality detection models.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          My goal is to create innovative solutions that simplify complex
          challenges and deliver meaningful user experiences.
